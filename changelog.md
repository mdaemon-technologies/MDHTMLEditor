# MDHTMLEditor Changelog

## 1.3.0 (May 21, 2026)

### New Features
- Added Speech to Text plugin — browser-native voice recognition using the Web Speech API
  - Full dialog with live transcript display (final + interim results), language selector, confidence indicator
  - Continuous recognition mode with auto-restart on browser timeout
  - Supports 31 languages matching the editor's locale system
  - Start/Stop toggle, Insert (at cursor position), and Clear controls
  - New `speech_to_text` config option (default: `true`) to enable/disable the feature
  - Graceful degradation: button shown disabled with tooltip in unsupported browsers (Firefox)
  - Dark mode support for oxide-dark and confab-dark skins
  - No external dependencies — uses built-in Web Speech API (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
- Added Dictate button — inline speech-to-text that inserts directly at the cursor without a dialog
  - Single-click toggle: click to start dictating, click again to stop
  - Text is inserted at the cursor in real-time as speech is recognized
  - Visual feedback: button turns red with pulsing indicator while active
  - Uses the same `speech_to_text` config option and language detection as the dialog version
  - Toolbar button name: `dictate` (place alongside or instead of `speechtotext`)

## 1.2.0 (May 14, 2026)

### New Features
- Added paste-from-Office support — detects and cleans HTML pasted from Microsoft Word and Excel while preserving formatting (bold, italic, underline, font family/size, colors, highlights, lists, tables, text alignment, line height, indentation)
  - Word list conversion: transforms Word's fake list paragraphs (`MsoListParagraph`) into proper `<ul>`/`<ol>` with correct nesting
  - Excel table normalization: preserves table structure, colspan/rowspan, and cell formatting while stripping Excel-specific attributes
  - Security hardening: strips `<script>`, `<iframe>`, event handlers, `javascript:` URLs, and `file://` references (defense-in-depth alongside TipTap's schema enforcement)
  - New `paste_from_office` config option (default: `true`) to enable/disable the feature
  - No new dependencies — zero bundle size impact

### Improvements
- Updated all TipTap packages from 3.23.1 to 3.23.4

## 1.0.14 (May 11, 2026)

### New Features
- Added responsive toolbar with priority-based button visibility for narrow containers (≤768px)
  - Tier 1 buttons (bold, italic, underline, undo, redo, link, forecolor) remain visible; all others collapse behind the existing toggle button
  - Container-width detection via ResizeObserver — works in sidebars, modals, and narrow panels regardless of viewport size
  - New `toolbar_narrow_breakpoint` config option to customize the width threshold (default: 768)
  - New `toolbar_priority` config option to override default button tier assignments
- Added touch device support via `@media (pointer: coarse)` — enlarges toolbar buttons to 44×44px on touch devices to meet WCAG 2.5.5 target size recommendations

## 1.0.13 (May 4, 2026)

### New Features
- Added Mention extension for inline @mention support (`span.composer-mention` atom nodes)
  - Enables `insertContent()` to correctly handle mention spans instead of escaping them as text
  - Parses and renders `<span class="composer-mention" contenteditable="false" data-jid="..." data-display="...">@Name</span>`
  - Inline, atomic, non-editable node that round-trips through the editor without data loss

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed clicking empty space in `.md-editor-content` not focusing the editor when content doesn't fill the container

## 1.0.12 (April 27, 2026)

### New Features
- Added confab skin (light and dark) with CSS custom property theming
- Added custom icon set support
- Added SignatureBlock extension
- Added SourceEditor dialog for raw HTML editing
- Added LinkEditor dialog for link creation and editing
- Added scoped CSS reset to protect editor internals from host-app CSS resets (e.g. Tailwind preflight)

### Improvements
- Upgraded to TypeScript 6
- Unified toolbar overflow into a single container for consistent button wrapping
- Positioned toolbar dropdown and color picker menus as fixed, appended to document.body, to prevent misalignment caused by parent CSS transforms
- Replaced text-based dropdown arrows with inline SVGs to prevent host-app font-size overrides from inflating arrow size
- Many feature updates and refinements

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed TSC compilation error
- Fixed Markdown table formatting in README
- Fixed dropdown menus appearing offset when host app uses CSS transforms on ancestor elements
- Fixed color picker not closing other open menus when opened
- Fixed dropdown item styles being overridden by scoped button reset (CSS specificity)
