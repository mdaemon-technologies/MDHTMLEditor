# MDHTMLEditor Changelog

## 1.4.2 (June 9, 2026)

### Bug Fixes
- **Insert/Edit Link** — URLs typed without a scheme (e.g. `www.example.com`, `example.com/path`) now have `http://` prepended automatically instead of being saved as relative links that resolve against the current page and break. Existing schemes (`https:`, `mailto:`, `tel:`, `ftp:`, …), anchors (`#…`), absolute/relative paths (`/`, `./`, `../`), and protocol-relative URLs (`//host`) are left untouched.
- **Paste toolbar button** — replaced the deprecated, browser-blocked `document.execCommand('paste')` with the async Clipboard API. The button now reads the clipboard (prompting for permission on first use), prefers `text/html` to preserve formatting, falls back to plain text, and strips the browser's clipboard scaffolding (`<meta>`, `StartFragment`/`EndFragment` markers) before inserting. Browsers that block programmatic clipboard reads (e.g. Firefox) fall back to Ctrl/Cmd+V, which the engine handles directly.
- **confab skin** — replaced the `removeformat` toolbar icon with a clearer eraser glyph.

### Internal
- Added a `document.elementFromPoint` polyfill to the Jest setup so the suite runs under jsdom (newer TipTap placeholder viewport tracking calls it during editor construction).

## 1.4.1 (June 5, 2026)

### Improvements
- Dependency and lockfile maintenance — bumped `@babel/*` to 7.29.7, `esbuild` platform binaries to 0.27.7, `@emnapi` core/runtime to 1.10.0 (and `wasi-threads` to 1.2.1), and `@adobe/css-tools` to 4.5.0; refreshed `package-lock.json`. No functional or API changes.

## 1.4.0 (June 5, 2026)

### New Features
- Added CKEditor feature parity for sites migrating off CKEditor 4:
  - **Read-only mode** — new `readonly` config option plus `setReadOnly(state)` / `isReadOnly()` methods; disables editing and dims/blocks the toolbar
  - **`forced_root_block` option** — set to `'div'` so Enter produces `<div>` blocks (CKEditor `ENTER_DIV` parity); defaults to `'p'`. The `<div id="signature">` signature block is preserved in either mode
  - **Subscript / Superscript** — new `subscript` and `superscript` toolbar buttons, `execCommand` support, and TipTap extensions
  - **Horizontal rule** — new `hr` toolbar button and `inserthorizontalrule` command
  - **Tables** — new `table` toolbar dropdown to insert tables and run row/column/cell operations (insert/delete row & column, merge/split cells, toggle header row, delete table)
  - **Block format dropdown** — new `blocks` button (alias `formatselect`) for Paragraph / Heading 1–6, customizable via `block_formats`
  - **Styles dropdown** — new `styles` button driven by a configurable, CKEditor `stylesSet`-compatible `style_formats` option (block elements, inline color/background, and CSS classes)
  - **Named anchors** — new `anchor` toolbar button and dialog inserting `<a id="name">` targets; preserves existing anchors through the parse/serialize cycle
  - **Unlink** — new `unlink` toolbar button and command to remove the link at the cursor
- Image upload improvements (CKEditor `simpleuploads` parity):
  - New `images_file_types` option to restrict accepted extensions (e.g. `'jpg,jpeg,png,gif,bmp'`); added BMP support
  - New `images_upload_validate` cancelable pre-upload hook (return a message to reject a file)
  - New `images_upload_error` callback so drag-drop and clipboard-paste rejections/failures route to a caller-supplied alert
- Added CKEditor config aliases `font_names` (→ `font_family_formats`) and `fontSize_sizes` (→ `font_size_formats`) for drop-in compatibility
- New default toolbars surface the new buttons; existing custom `toolbar` strings are unaffected
- Translated the new UI strings into all 31 supported locales

### Improvements
- Added `@tiptap/extension-subscript`, `@tiptap/extension-superscript`, and a direct `@tiptap/extension-paragraph` dependency

## 1.3.0 (May 21, 2026)

### New Features
- Added Speech to Text plugin — browser-native voice recognition using the Web Speech API
  - Full dialog with live transcript display (final + interim results), language selector, confidence indicator
  - Continuous recognition mode with auto-restart on browser timeout
  - Supports 31 languages matching the editor's locale system
  - Start/Stop toggle, Insert (at cursor position), and Clear controls
  - New `speech_to_text` config option (default: `true`) to enable/disable the feature
  - Graceful degradation: button shown disabled with tooltip in unsupported browsers (Firefox)
  - Dark mode support for oxide-dark and confab-dark skins
  - No external dependencies — uses built-in Web Speech API (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
- Added Dictate button — inline speech-to-text that inserts directly at the cursor without a dialog
  - Single-click toggle: click to start dictating, click again to stop
  - Text is inserted at the cursor in real-time as speech is recognized
  - Visual feedback: button turns red with pulsing indicator while active
  - Uses the same `speech_to_text` config option and language detection as the dialog version
  - Toolbar button name: `dictate` (place alongside or instead of `speechtotext`)

## 1.2.0 (May 14, 2026)

### New Features
- Added paste-from-Office support — detects and cleans HTML pasted from Microsoft Word and Excel while preserving formatting (bold, italic, underline, font family/size, colors, highlights, lists, tables, text alignment, line height, indentation)
  - Word list conversion: transforms Word's fake list paragraphs (`MsoListParagraph`) into proper `<ul>`/`<ol>` with correct nesting
  - Excel table normalization: preserves table structure, colspan/rowspan, and cell formatting while stripping Excel-specific attributes
  - Security hardening: strips `<script>`, `<iframe>`, event handlers, `javascript:` URLs, and `file://` references (defense-in-depth alongside TipTap's schema enforcement)
  - New `paste_from_office` config option (default: `true`) to enable/disable the feature
  - No new dependencies — zero bundle size impact

### Improvements
- Updated all TipTap packages from 3.23.1 to 3.23.4

## 1.0.14 (May 11, 2026)

### New Features
- Added responsive toolbar with priority-based button visibility for narrow containers (≤768px)
  - Tier 1 buttons (bold, italic, underline, undo, redo, link, forecolor) remain visible; all others collapse behind the existing toggle button
  - Container-width detection via ResizeObserver — works in sidebars, modals, and narrow panels regardless of viewport size
  - New `toolbar_narrow_breakpoint` config option to customize the width threshold (default: 768)
  - New `toolbar_priority` config option to override default button tier assignments
- Added touch device support via `@media (pointer: coarse)` — enlarges toolbar buttons to 44×44px on touch devices to meet WCAG 2.5.5 target size recommendations

## 1.0.13 (May 4, 2026)

### New Features
- Added Mention extension for inline @mention support (`span.composer-mention` atom nodes)
  - Enables `insertContent()` to correctly handle mention spans instead of escaping them as text
  - Parses and renders `<span class="composer-mention" contenteditable="false" data-jid="..." data-display="...">@Name</span>`
  - Inline, atomic, non-editable node that round-trips through the editor without data loss

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed clicking empty space in `.md-editor-content` not focusing the editor when content doesn't fill the container

## 1.0.12 (April 27, 2026)

### New Features
- Added confab skin (light and dark) with CSS custom property theming
- Added custom icon set support
- Added SignatureBlock extension
- Added SourceEditor dialog for raw HTML editing
- Added LinkEditor dialog for link creation and editing
- Added scoped CSS reset to protect editor internals from host-app CSS resets (e.g. Tailwind preflight)

### Improvements
- Upgraded to TypeScript 6
- Unified toolbar overflow into a single container for consistent button wrapping
- Positioned toolbar dropdown and color picker menus as fixed, appended to document.body, to prevent misalignment caused by parent CSS transforms
- Replaced text-based dropdown arrows with inline SVGs to prevent host-app font-size overrides from inflating arrow size
- Many feature updates and refinements

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed TSC compilation error
- Fixed Markdown table formatting in README
- Fixed dropdown menus appearing offset when host app uses CSS transforms on ancestor elements
- Fixed color picker not closing other open menus when opened
- Fixed dropdown item styles being overridden by scoped button reset (CSS specificity)

## 1.0.0 (February 13, 2026)

### Initial Public Release
- Created TipTap-based HTML editor as a TinyMCE-compatible replacement
- Added comprehensive test suite
